IHateYourDevice
===============

A simple page to demonstrate the hatred against any device/OS.

Realized through <code>$_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT']</code> and a complicated constructs of switches, arrays and if-conditions, we don't even understand anymore.

All in all it was just a little project as a pastime.

A live demo is available at http://ihateyourdevice.herrlevin.de/

Have fun!
